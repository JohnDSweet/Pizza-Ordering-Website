# Pizza Ordering Website

### Author: John Sweet

### Epicodus: Intro to Programming
This portfolio serves as the final code review project for the Epicodus program.

### Ping Pong Objectives
Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

### Objectives

  Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

  * Code meets standards from previous weeks.
  * Objects drive business logic (in JavaScript, not jQuery).
  * Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
  * Application works as expected.
  * Plain English specs are present in README.
